CSEN 602 Operating Systems, Spring 2023
Project Description
Project Objective
The best way for you to understand the concepts of an Operating System is to build
an operating system and then to experiment with it to see how the OS manages
resources and processes. In this project, you are asked to build a simulation of
an operating system. The main focus of the project will be on building a correct
architecture that simulates a real operating system. You will be graded on
both a correct implementation and a correct architecture.
Description
In this project, you are asked to implement a basic interpreter. You have a text
file that represents a program. When you read that text file and start executing
it, it becomes a process. You are provided with 3 program files each representing a program. You are asked to create an interpreter that reads
the txt files and executes their code. You are asked to implement a
memory and save the processes in it. You are also asked to implement
mutexes that ensure mutual exclusion over the critical resources. And
finally, You are also asked to implement a scheduler that schedules the
processes that we have in our system.
System Calls
System calls are the process’s way of requesting a service from the OS. In order
for a process to be able to use any of the available hardware, it makes a request,
system call, to the operating system.
Types of system calls required:
1. Read the data of any file from the disk.
2. Write text output to a file in the disk.
3. Print data on the screen.

4. Take text input from the user.
5. Reading data from memory.
6. Writing data to memory.
Memory
One of the steps the OS does in order to create a new process is allocating a space
for it in the main memory. The OS is responsible for managing the memory and
its allocation.
The memory is of a fixed size. It is made up of 40 memory words. The memory
is large enough to hold the un-parsed lines of code, variables and PCB for any of
the processes. The memory is divided into memory words, each word can store 1
variable and it’s corresponding data. For simplicity, feel free to specify a naming
convention for the variable names associated with the lines of code and elements
of the PCB. Processes should not access any data outside their allocated memory
block.
A process should only be created at it’s arrival time. A process is considered
created when it’s program file is read into lines and it gets assigned a part of the
memory for instructions, variables and it’s PCB. Assume that each process needs
enough space for 3 variables.
Feel free to separate the lines of code, variables and PCB within the memory
if needed as long as they fall within the same data structure meant to represent
the memory.
Your code needs to be able to handle the case where the memory is not large
enough to run all the processes. When a new process is created, the system checks
if there is enough space, if not the system will unload one of the existing processes
and store it’s data on the disk. Feel free to assume the format for the memory
when stored on the disk. However while unloaded, the process remains in the
scheduler, thus when it is time for the unloaded process to run again, the process
memory is swapped back into the memory from the disk. As a result, you need to
program a way to read and write an existing process’s data to/from the disk as
well as manage the swapping between the process’s while protecting each process’s
memory.
Process Control Block
A process control block is a data structure used by computer operating systems to
store all the information about a process.In order to schedule your processes, you

will need to keep a PCB for every process. The PCB should contain the following
information:
1. Process ID (The process is given an ID when is being created)
2. Process State
3. Program Counter
4. Memory Boundaries
Programs
We have 3 main Programs:
Program 1: Given 2 numbers, the program prints the numbers between the 2
given numbers on the screen.
Program 2: Given a filename and data, the program writes the data to the file.
Assume that the file doesn’t exist and should always be created.
Program 3: Given a filename, the program prints the contents of the file on the
screen.
Program Syntax
For the programs, the following syntax is used:
• print: to print the output on the screen. Example: print x
• assign: to initialize a new variable and assign a value to it. Example:
assign x y, where x is the variable and y is the value assigned. The value
could be an integer number, or a string. If y is input, it first prints to the
screen "Please enter a value", then the value is taken as an input from
the user.
• writeFile: to write data to a file. Example: writeFile x y, where x is
the filename and y is the data.
• readFile: to read data from a file. Example: readFile x, where x is the
filename
• printFromTo: to print all numbers between 2 numbers. Example: printFromTo
x y, where x is the first number, and y is the second number.

• semWait: to acquire a resource. Example: semWait x, where x is the resource name. For more details refer to section Mutual Exclusion
• semSignal: to release a resource. Example: semSignal x, where x is the
resource name. For more details refer to section Mutual Exclusion
Mutual Exclusion
A mutex is a directive provided by the OS used to control access to a shared
resource between processes in a concurrent system such as a multi-programming
operating system by using two atomic operations, semwait and semsignal. Mutexes
are used to ensure mutual exclusion over the critical section.
You are required to implement 3 mutexes, one for each resource we
have:
1. Accessing a file, to read or to write.
2. Taking user input
3. Outputting on the screen.
Whenever a mutex is used, either a semWait or semSignal instruction is followed
by the name of the resource, userInput, userOutput or file. For an illustration,
to print on the screen:-
1. semWait userOutput: any process calls it whenever it wants to print
something on the screen to acquire the key of the resource.
2. semSignal userInput: any process calls it whenever it finishes printing to
release the key of the resource.
Note: ONLY ONE process is allowed to use the resource at a time. If a process
requests the use of a resource while it is being used by another process, it should
be blocked and added to the blocked queue of this resource and the general blocked
queue.
Scheduler
A scheduler is responsible for scheduling between the processes in the Ready
Queue. It ensures that all processes get a chance to execute. A scheduling Algorithm is an algorithm that chooses the process that gets to execute. As mentioned
in the lecture, there are many different scheduling algorithms to schedule processes.

In this project, you are required to implement the Round Robin algorithm. Round
robin is a scheduling algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slice.
For this project, each process executes 2 instructions in its time slice.
Processes arrive in this order: Process 1 arrives at time 0, Process 2 arrives at
time 1, and Process 3 arrives at time 4.
Queues
• Ready Queue: For the processes currently waiting to be chosen to execute
on the processor
• Blocked Queue: For the processes currently waiting for resources to be available
Output
For this Milestone, your Simulated OS should be able to read the provided programs and execute them. You should make sure to have the following outputs read
to show for the evaluation:
• Queues should be printed after every scheduling event, i.e. when a process
is chosen, blocked, or finished.
• Which process is currently executing.
• The instruction that is currently executing
• Time slice is subject to change, i.e. you might be asked to change it to x
instructions per time slice.
• Order in which the processes are scheduled are subject to change.
• The timings in which processes arrive are subject to change
• The memory shown every clock cycle in a human readable format.
• The ID of any process whenever it is swapped in or out of disk.
• The format of the memory stored on Disk.
Please make sure that the output is readable, and presentable.
